# mental_health_data_analysis_finland
Mental health includes a personâ€™s emotional, psychological, and social well-being. The goal of our project is to make a tool that helps public health administrators reduce mental health problems based on data. The website below will show you a mental health index and its related socio-economic effects all over Finland. This ML model is built based on Kela and Stat.fi data.
